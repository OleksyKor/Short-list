# Code Review Checklist

##General

* Does the code work? Does it perform its intended function, the logic is correct etc.
* Is all the code easily understood?
* Does it conform to your agreed coding conventions? These will usually cover location of braces, variable and function names, line length, indentations, formatting, and comments.
* Is there any redundant or duplicate code?
* Is the code as modular as possible?
* Can any global variables be replaced?
* Is there any commented out code?
* Do loops have a set length and correct termination conditions?
* Can any of the code be replaced with library functions?
* Can any logging or debugging code be removed?
